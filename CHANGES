*1.0.2* (February 12th, 2008)

 - The deleteHandler now works as expected. Turns out "delete" is a reserved
   word in JavaScript, so the internal delete function was renamed to destroy.
   Also added listeners for the standard delete key code as well as Safari's
   crazy delete key code.

*1.0.1* (November 27th, 2007)

 - Fixed an issue with the examples and documentation that prevented Internet
   Explorer from initializing the MatrixView.

 - Replaced the images that were being used in the Photo Gallery example, as
   the ones used previously are no longer covered under a Creative Commons
   license. This change was also retroactively applied to the 1.0.0 package.

*1.0.0* (November 16th, 2007)

 - Initial Release
