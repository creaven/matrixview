*1.0.1* (November 27th, 2007)

 - Fixed an issue with the examples and documentation that prevented Internet
   Explorer from initializing the MatrixView.

 - Replaced the images that were being used in the Photo Gallery example, as
   the ones used previously are no longer covered under a Creative Commons
   license. This change was also retroactively applied to the 1.0.0 package.
